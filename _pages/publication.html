                  <p class="text-muted">Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of markers associated with various complex traits and diseases, our ability to predict such phenotypes remains limited. A perhaps ignored explanation lies in the limitations of the genetic models and statistical techniques commonly used in association studies. However, using genotype data for individuals to perform accurate genetic prediction of complex traits can promote genomic selection in animal and plant breeding and can lead to the development of personalized medicine in humans. Because most complex traits have a polygenic architecture, accurate genetic prediction often requires modeling genetic variants together via polygenic methods. Here, we also utilize our proposed polygenic methods, which refer to as the iterative screen regression model (ISR) for genome prediction. We compared ISR with several commonly used prediction methods with simulations. We further applied ISR to predicting 15 traits, including the five species of cattle, rice, wheat, maize, and mice. The results of the study indicate that the ISR method performs well than several commonly used polygenic methods and stability.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">Here, we show that leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is a functional ligand of Tie1, a poorly characterized endothelial cell (EC)-specific orphan receptor. Upon binding to Tie1, LECT2 interrupts Tie1/Tie2 heterodimerization, facilitates Tie2/Tie2 homodimerization, activates PPAR signaling, and inhibits the migration and tube formations of EC. In vivo studies showed that LECT2 overexpression inhibits portal angiogenesis, promotes sinusoid capillarization, and worsens fibrosis, whereas these changes were reversed in Lect2-KO mice. Adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-LECT2 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) treatment significantly attenuates fibrosis. Upregulation of LECT2 is associated with advanced human liver fibrosis staging. We concluded that targeting LECT2/Tie1 signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and serum LECT2 level may be a potential biomarker for the screening and diagnosis of liver fibrosis.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">Loss of Hippo tumor-suppressor activity and hyperactivation of YAP are commonly observed in cancers. Inactivating mutations of Hippo kinases MST1/2 are uncommon, and it remains unclear how their activity is turned off during tumorigenesis. We identified STRN3 as an essential regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that recruits MST1/2 and promotes its dephosphorylation, which results in YAP activation. We also identified STRN3 upregulation in gastric cancer correlated with YAP activation and poor prognosis. Based on this mechanistic understanding and aided by structure-guided medicinal chemistry, we developed a highly selective peptide inhibitor, STRN3-derived Hippo-activating peptide, or SHAP, which disrupts the STRN3-PP2Aa interaction and reactivates the Hippo tumor suppressor, inhibits YAP activation, and has antitumor effects in vivo.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted"></p><p>The microbiota in the human gut is strongly correlated with the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) and with therapeutic responses to CRC. Here, by leveraging the higher concentration of the pro-tumoural Fusobacterium nucleatum and the absence of antineoplastic butyrate-producing bacteria in the faecal microbiota of patients with CRC, we show that—in mice with orthotopic colorectal tumours or with spontaneously formed colorectal tumours—oral or intravenous administration of irinotecan-loaded dextran nanoparticles covalently linked to azide-modified phages that inhibit the growth of F. nucleatum significantly augments the efficiency of first-line chemotherapy treatments of CRC. We also show that oral administration of the phage-guided irinotecan-loaded nanoparticles in piglets led to negligible changes in haemocyte counts, immunoglobulin and histamine levels, and liver and renal functions. Phage-guided nanotechnology for the modulation of the gut microbiota might inspire new approaches for the treatment of CRC.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Using noninvasive stimulation of cells to control cell fate and improve bone regeneration by optical stimulation can achieve the aim of precisely orchestrating biological activities. In this study, we create a fast and repeatable photoelectric-responsive microenvironment around an implant using a bismuth sulfide/hydroxyapatite (BS/HAp) film. The unexpected increase of photocurrent on the BS/HAp film under near-infrared (NIR) light is mainly due to the depletion of holes through PO43– from HAp and interfacial charge transfer by HAp compared with BS. The electrons activate the Na+ channel of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and change the cell adhesion in the intermediate environment. The behavior of MSCs is tuned by changing the photoelectronic microenvironment. RNA sequencing reveals that when photoelectrons transfer to the cell membrane, sodium ions flux and the membrane potential depolarizes to change the cell shape. Meanwhile, calcium ions fluxed and FDE1 was upregulated. Furthermore, the TCF/LEF in the cell nucleus began transcription to regulate the downstream genes involved in osteogenic differentiation, which is performed through the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway. This research has created a biological therapeutic strategy, which can achieve in vitro remotely, precisely, and noninvasively controlling cell differentiation behaviors by tuning the in vivo photoelectric microenvironment using NIR light.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Here, we generate a vaccine-based nanosystem by integrating siRNA for Cd274 into the commercial human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 (HPV16 L1) protein. This nanosystem has good biosafety and enhances the therapeutic response rate of anti-tumor immunotherapy. The HPV16 L1 protein activates innate immunity through the type I interferon pathway and exhibits an efficient anti-cancer effect when cooperating with ICB therapy. For both resectable and unresectable breast tumors, the nanosystem decreases 71% tumor recurrence and extends progression-free survival by 67%. Most importantly, the nanosystem successfully induces high response rates in various genetically modified breast cancer models with different antigen loads. The strong immune stimulation elicited by this vaccine-based nanosystem might constitute an approach to significantly improve current ICB immunotherapy.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="timeline-body">
                    <p class="text-muted">The Hippo–YAP signaling pathway plays an essential role in epithelial cells during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism linking stromal signals to YAP‐mediated intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis is poorly defined. Here, we report a stroma–epithelium ISLR–YAP signaling axis essential for stromal cells to modulate epithelial cell growth during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Specifically, upon inflammation and in cancer, an oncogenic transcription factor ETS1 in stromal cells induces expression of a secreted protein ISLR that can inhibit Hippo signaling and activate YAP in epithelial cells. Deletion of Islr in stromal cells in mice markedly impaired intestinal regeneration and suppressed tumorigenesis in the colon. Moreover, the expression of stromal cell‐specific ISLR and ETS1 significantly increased in inflamed mucosa of human IBD patients and in human colorectal adenocarcinoma, accounting for the epithelial YAP hyperactivation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the signaling crosstalk between stroma and epithelium during tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted"> Here, we highlight the multifaceted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises numerous soluble factors including amphiregulin (AREG). Production of AREG is triggered by DNA damage to stromal cells, which passively enter senescence in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a process that remarkably enhances cancer malignancy including acquired resistance mediated by EGFR. Furthermore, paracrine AREG induces programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in recipient cancer cells and creates an immunosuppressive TME via immune checkpoint activation against cytotoxic lymphocytes. Targeting AREG not only minimized chemoresistance of cancer cells, but also restored immunocompetency when combined with classical chemotherapy in humanized animals. Our study underscores the potential of in vivo SASP in driving the TME-mediated drug resistance and shaping an immunosuppressive niche, and provides the proof of principle of targeting major SASP factors to improve therapeutic outcome in cancer medicine, the success of which can substantially reduce aging-related morbidity and mortality.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">SummaryHyperosmotic stress caused by drought and salinity is a significant environmental factor that limits plant growth and agricultural productivity. Plants respond to osmotic stress by activating Ca2+ signaling, accumulating the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), reprogramming gene expression and altering growth. Despite intensive efforts, no global regulators of all of these responses have been identified. Here, we show that the Ca2+-responsive phospholipid binding BONZAI proteins are critical for Ca2+ signaling, ABA accumulation, gene expression reprogramming and plant growth under osmotic stress by antagonizing plant immune responses mediated by intracellular immune receptor NLRs. Using a Ca2+-imaging-based forward genetic screen, we found that the Arabidopsis osmo1/bon1 mutant plants display a reduced cytosolic Ca2+ signal in response to hyperosmotic stress. The bon1/bon2/bon3 triple mutants are impaired in osmotic stress induction of gene regulation and ABA accumulation.</p><!--ul>

                    <p class="text-muted">Summary: Dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate the initiation, programming, and regulation of anti-tumor immune responses. Emerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment (TME) induces immune dysfunctional tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs), characterized with both increased intracellular lipid content and mitochondrial respiration. The underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unclear. Here, we report that fatty acid-carrying tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) induce immune dysfunctional DCs to promote immune evasion. Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α responds to the fatty acids delivered by TDEs, resulting in excess lipid droplet biogenesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO), culminating in a metabolic shift toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which drives DC immune dysfunction. Genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of PPARα effectively attenuates TDE-induced DC-based immune dysfunction and enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy. This work uncovers a role for TDE-mediated immune modulation in DCs and reveals that PPARα lies at the center of metabolic-immune regulation of DCs, suggesting a potential immunotherapeutic target.</p><!--ul>
