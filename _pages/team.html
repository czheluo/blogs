	<p>I am mostly interested in better understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits by using advanced statistical models and methods based on the quantitative genetic theory, molecular information and bioinformatics technology. I have developed new statistical approaches to use genome-wide SNPs marker data to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits, e.g. GWAS and predicting unobserved future phenotypes based on genome-wide SNPs information. The developed statistical approaches can be used to analyze any of the health-related traits in humans and many other traits of interest in many species. Currently, I focus on using the new advanced statistical methods combined with bioinformatics technology pinpointing biological mechanisms. e.g. researched 880 rice samples that implemented GWAS for yield-related traits (eQTL(gene regulation) and mGWAS (metabolism)) and genome selection which in multiple environments and four years. And also included mRNA sequencing, lncRNA, circular RNA, and small RNA sequencing, etc. RNA-Seq also provides an affordable approach for gene expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis among groups of samples. It is widely used in disease research and personalized healthcare research which combined high-throughput multi-omics approaches. I have highly motivated computational analyses and tools for mining large scale omics and genetic data for trait lead discovery which is highly desired.</a></p>
